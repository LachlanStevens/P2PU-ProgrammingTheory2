Exercise 1:
	Write a program which defines a parent company class with a function print_summary() which outputs " | | ", and two children classes: Supplier and Client. 
	Populate one array with Suppliers, and one array with Clients, then loop through each array calling the print_summary() function so you effectively print out a phonebook of clients and suppliers ordered by those groupings.
